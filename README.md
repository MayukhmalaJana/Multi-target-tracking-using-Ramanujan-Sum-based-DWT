# Abstract

Wavelets are powerful set of tools used for Computer Vision. Ramanujan sums-based wavelet transform is relatively new in the field of signal processing. In this paper the Ramanujan Sum based DWT (Discrete wavelet transform) is implemented to tackle the problem of multitarget tracking using wavelets. A novel multi-target tracking algorithm is proposed based on DWT. The implementation is done for real time video sequences. The result is compared to Haar & Daubechies based DWT tracking algorithm and performance is better in the video sequences that have been evaluated on the Ramanujan sums-based DWT tracking algorithm. Also, as Ramanujan sums-based wavelet transform use integer coefficients and the normalization can be performed at a later stage, it would be easier to form hardware on this.

# Usage

**Required Input :** 

  Source static image sequence three frames (i1,i2,i3) and
                     groundtruth image (igt)
 
**Output :**    

         (1) Metrics: ri,gce,vi
         
         (2) Segmented Image: itr 
         
         (3) Original Image with bounding box: ii
         
         (4) The coordinates of bounding box: s
  
**Usage :**

          Here is the main code for running the ors tracking methodology,
          please download other functions and datasets to run the main
          files properly. 
          
          For three image frame use: ORS_Tracking_main.m and
          for using video for tracking use: ORS_Tracking_byaircraft_main.m
          
          For example purpose, three image frame data has been given with the ground-truth image.
          Please download your own video and respective groundtruth frames to use the ORS_Tracking_byaircraft_main.m file.
